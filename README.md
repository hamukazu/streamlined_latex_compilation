# streamlined_latex_compilation

This is a sophisticated book writing platform. Whenever you push files to the main branch on GitHub, the system automatically compiles them and uploads the resulting PDF file to the release page.

The resulting PDF file is named in the following format: "sample-yyyymmdd-i", where "yyyymmdd" represents the date, and "i" is a sequential number within that date.

## Usage
To try this out, select "Create a new repository" after clicking "Use this template".

Next, configure the permissions for your new repository. Go to 'Settings', then 'Actions' on the left sidebar, and then the 'General' tab. Under the 'Workflow permissions' section, ensure that 'Read and write permissions' is selected.

Now you can modify sample.txt. It is automatically compiled when it is pushed to the repository.
